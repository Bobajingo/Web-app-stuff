FYI on using flask. I presume you guys have all downloaded it.

I created a python enviornment for software engineering so if you guys have one too then activate that. 
Open up command line, then you need to change the directory to where you're keeping the folder with the flask files. 
On windows:
1. change enviornment to development
set FLASK_ENV=development
2. change the debug status to true (this allows you to make code changes and then refresh)
set FLASK_DEBUG=True
3. initialise the flask app to run
set FLASK_RUN=map.py (as long as map.py (the flask file) is in the same directory, this should work)
4. Run the flask app
flask run
5. Open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Sorry Enci! I'm not sure of the windows steps
Can't be sure but I think you just drop the set before all of the FLASK thingys

Hopefully  this works for you guys!!!
